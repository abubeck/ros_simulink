Integration of the mathworks simulink real time workshop toolchain with ros. Allows you to create simulink controllers and connect them with ros topics for input and output.

Provided tools:
rosmatlab:
	rosrun ros_simulink matlab
	launches matlab with an additional xmlrpc server 
	to remote control simulink from the ros toolchain

load:
	rosrun ros_simulink load <mdl file | ros_package_name>

compile:
	rosrun ros_simulink compile <ros_package_name>
	compiles the simulink model in “package_dir/simulink/package_name.mdl” 
	to the “package_dir/rtw/” directory and generates ros 
	code for interfacing the rtw c-files

roscreate-simulinkpkg
	creates ros package with dependencies, file system setup 
	and a simulink file with rtw settings and simulation 
	settings ready to go

cmake integration:
	use the cmake statement to generate ros_simulink binary
	gen_simulink_bin(executable_name mdl-file)
